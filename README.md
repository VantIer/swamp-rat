# Swamp RAT

A `linux` RAT that lurks where others do not.

# Purpose

I started this as most free `linux` RATs are done half hazardly in higher level languages.

# Dependancies
- [`openssl`](https://www.openssl.org/) - libssl-dev

# Building Swamp RAT
```bash
make
sudo make install
```

# TODO
- Communication Protocol
- Keylogging
- AntiVM
- RE Evasion
